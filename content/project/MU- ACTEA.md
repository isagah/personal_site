# Project title.
title = "Applied Curricula in Technology for East Africa"

summary = "I am a project member to this transforming project also refered to [ACTEA](https://www.actea.net/), which aims to change the delivery of technology and engineering programs in East African universities from theory oriented to practice oriented mode. At the moment, I assist local coordinators in managing project activites and conduct research to complement project goals and activities.  I belive in the expectations of the project that in the end of the project Mzumbe University and other beneficiaries will have the capacity in terms of resource person and infrastructure to build the competence of their students in a way that it fits to market demand in the era of industralization in Africa"
