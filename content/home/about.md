# Biography

I am a research analyst enthusiast focused on designing information systems. I enjoy solving problems using analytical skills and design digital solutions to address challenges faced in organizations. I have skills in information systems analysis and design and competent in different methods of analysis and evaluation as well as impact assessment. Also, I have good command of design research methods, enterprise architecture frameworks and requirement engineering methods. 

In my PhD research, I focused on the design of mobile applications for delivering public services. The study analyzed the existing challenges of providing government services via mobile technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for improving the design of such services while considering the complexity of government data and information processes. Also, the framework took into account the context of a country and government organization such as political, economic, managerial, etc. to design useful and sustainable services.
