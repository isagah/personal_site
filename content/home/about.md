# Biography

A research analyst enthusiast about solving complex problems using analytical skills, and deploying digital technologies to address challenges faced in organizations and communities. 

I am interested in public sector digital transformation. My passion is on guiding the government in the process of planning and implementing digitalitazion. I focused on the design and delivery of government services via mobile applications. The study aimed to improve the adoption and sustainability of mobile technologies in accessing public services. The goal was achieved by analyzing the existing challenges of providing government services via mobile technologies, deriving the requirements of an approach that will address the challenges, and proposing a comprehensive framework for improving the quality of services while considering the complexity of government data and information processes. Also, the framework took into account the context of a country and government organization such as political, economic, managerial, etc. to design useful and sustainable services. 

Currently, I am researching the transformation of AI in Africa. I am interested in helping AI pratcitioners in Tanzania and Africa to determine factors that will contribute to AI transformation in their local context, and guiding them in the implementation process so as to promote the design of AI for social good.
