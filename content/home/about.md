# Biography

I am a PhD researcher at [University of Koblenz-Landau in Koblenz](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en), Germany  advised by [Prof.Dr. Maria A. Wimmer](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/koblenz/fb4/iwvi/agvinf/team/maria-wimmer). My Ph.D. research focuses on the design of mobile applications for delivering public services. The study analyzes the existing challenges of providing government services via mobile devices and proposes a comprehensive framework for improving the design of such services while considering the complexity of government information processes. Also, the framework takes into account the context of a country and government organization such as political, economic, managerial, etc. to design useful and sustainable services. 

I have experience in designing ICT for the government, ICT4D, citizen engagement, and enterprise architecture. Also, I have basic knowledge of data analysis by using the Python programming language.
