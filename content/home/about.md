I am a research analyst enthusiast about solving complex problems using analytical skills and deploying digital technologies to address organizational and community challenges. 


Currently, I am researching the transformation of AI in Africa. I want to help AI practitioners in Tanzania and Africa to determine factors that will contribute to transforming our local communities through the technology, and guide them in the implementation process. My goal is to promote the design and use of AI for social good suitable for our context.
