# Biography

I am a PhD candidate at [University of Koblenz-Landau in Koblenz](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en), Germany  advised by [Prof.Dr. Maria A. Wimmer](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/de/koblenz/fb4/iwvi/agvinf/team/maria-wimmer). My PhD research focuses on the design of mobile applications for delivering public services. The study analyzes the existing challenges of providing government services via mobile devices and proposes a comprehensive framework for improving the design of such services while considering the complexity of government information processes. I have experiences in e-government, ICT4D and citizen engagement.
