abstract = " Despite the potential of m-government in developing countries, research in its design and implementation is still scarce. In an empirical study, requirements of m-government service design have been elicited in developing countries. The study focused on requirements regarding the design and the approaches used to design m-government services. This paper presents part of the empirical results. Raw data were collected through questionnaires and interviews. To analyze collected data, we used MAXQDA software. Results presented in this paper include significant requirements of m-government services and design characteristics and approaches for addressing them. The paper demonstrates a lack of understanding and unclear approaches for addressing requirements of m-government services, which is, however, imperative to ensure successful design and implementation of m-government. We conclude with suggestions for addressing the requirements at the government level."
